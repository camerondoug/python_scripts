Python Scripts
====================

###In this repository are some python scripts I've developed.

#download_file_from_ftp.py
This file was created to auto download a ESRI shape file from a ftp site.

The scripts in the ArcPy folder are a example of some basic fuctions that python
can do when interacting with ArcGIS.
